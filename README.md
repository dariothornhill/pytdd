# Learning unit testing in python using pytest

I created this repo as I worked through learning pytest. It is by no means exhaustive and it assumes you new to python but not new to unit testing.
I first learned unit testing with PHPUnit and may be prone to use PHP and XUNIT jargon.

## Setup and execution

This project uses pipenv. I made this decision because of my experience with composer, npm and yarn.
You can learn more about [how to setup and use pipenv here](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/ 'RTFM')

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
python -m pytest
```
